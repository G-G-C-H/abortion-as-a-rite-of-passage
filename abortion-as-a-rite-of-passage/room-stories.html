        i found out i was pregnant early on a wednesday morning. deep down i
        knew something had changed inside me even before taking the test.
        <br />
        i knew what i had to do straight away, raising a child hadn't been part
        of my plan.
        <br /><br />
        still i cried. what if this is one of those moments during which life
        throws something unexpected at you and you make it work. what if this
        what i need to finally feel like i can 'grow up' and take owndership of
        my life.
        <br />
        no - this is not how i want to do it if i were to do it.
        <br />
        <br />
        for two days i felt confused but not alone. it was a strange sensation
        of completeness that i still have a hard time explaining.
        <br />
        i felt something change inside me. it would grow overtime as i went
        through with the termination.
        <br />
        i started the process of a medical abortion early on a monday morning. i
        took the first pill at the clinic and the other pills the following
        days. i didn't bleed straight away. two days later the flood gates
        opened.
        <br />
        i felt weak and broken for weeks after.
        <br />
        the people at the clinic had been kind and i hadn't felt alone at the
        beginning.
        <br />
        <br />
        as time went on i felt more and more lonely. i was going through a lot
        and felt often i couldn't tell the people surrounding me. only my
        closest knew and my closest often weren't even close in physical space.
        <br />
        i yearned for sharing this experience. an exchange of breath, of touch,
        of sigh. where are my sisters?
