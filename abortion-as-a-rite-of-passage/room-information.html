            One-third of women in the UK will have an abortion before their 45th
            birthday (Hannah Thomson, Midwife Practitioner, British Pregnancy
            Advisory Service; and Maternity Advocate). <br />
            This statistic is shocking, not because of the number of people
            having abortions, but because it exposes how very few people feel
            comfortable sharing their experience. <br /><br />
            "What occurs during childbirth teaches the woman about herself and
            about how her culture values motherhood" (Reed, Reclaiming Birth as
            a Rite of Passage). This is as true for childbirth as it is for
            abortion––so what are people experiencing abortion learning about
            themselves and how their society values them? <br />
            The stigma surrounding abortion poses a serious threat to the way in
            which people will perceive themselves, their bodies and their power.
            <br /><br />
            Our national healthcare system treats abortion as a one-point
            medical solution, neglecting to support the emotional and spirtual
            transformation of the person undergoing a termination (Zachi,
            abortion doula https://www.wearedopo.com/about). <br /><br />
            After researching rites of passage across cultures and religions,
            what has emerged is that a crucial aspect to make a successful
            passage is that it is necessary for the individuals undergoing the
            transformation to receive support and affirmation from their
            community. This is an aspect that is currently missing within our
            healthcare system as people are made to have to go through this
            transformation on their own or in secrecy for fear of being shamed.
            <br /><br />
            Could creating a community-lead support group help individuals feel
            better held when going through an abortion? And together, can we
            empower people to celebrate their choice and their right to choose? <br/><br/>
